# custom-wallpapers
Custom wallpapers created by me. Feel free to use them as you see fit.

This is the repo for my custom made wallpapers. I made each one of these in inkscape for use on my website. I made a lot of custom graphics for the website and put a lot of effort into them. After they were finished I used them for my desktop. I then made my alacirtty config file match the general theme, and that config file is also located here. Feel free to edit, share, modifity and use these wallpapers in any way you see fit. I am really proud of them and hope that you enjoy them as much as I do! If you want the rest of the graphics I made for my website, you can find those here: https://candy-canine-juno.neocities.org/

My website also contains some of my raw .svg files, so you can feel free to edit them as you please, or use them in your own projects.
